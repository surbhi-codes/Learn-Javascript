// ARRAYS:-
// Arrays in Javascript are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are like a list that can hold items such as numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays.

// JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types
// JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays
// JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on â€” and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
// JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).

const myArr = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
const myHeors = ["Ironman", "Spiderman"]

//const myArr = new Array(1,2,3,4)
console.log(myArr[1]);
