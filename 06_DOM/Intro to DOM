DOM - Document Object Model

DOM is a programming interface for web documents.
It represents the HTML or XML of a webpage as a tree structure where each node is an object.
JavaScript can interact with this structure to manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically.
In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.

A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).
A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).
