                    -: HISTORY & EVOLUTION :-

# JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.
# Javascript [initially (Livescript)] was invented by "Brendan Eich" in 1995 [Mocha]
  1997 - ECMAScript
  2005 - AJAX [Asynhronous JS & XML]
  2009 - Node.js was released
  2015 - ECMAScript 6 [ES6] (modern features were added)
  2016 to present- Continued Updates
# In HTML  the javascript code is inserted in <script></script> tag
# A single <script> tag canâ€™t have both the src attribute and code inside.
# A script in an external file can be inserted with <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>


                   -: DEFINATION :-  

# Javascript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. It can control the behaviour of different elements on a website such as - animations, forms, dynamic content updates.
# The programs in this language are called scripts
# Javascript is a Synchronous [executes one command at a time] & single-threaded language.
# JavaScript is both an imperative [how to do something with detailed instructions] and declarative [what you want to achieve & let the language figure out the details] type of language.
# It works alongside-
  HTML (Structures the Content)[Skeleton]
  CSS (Styles the Content) [Skin]
  JavaScript (Provides the Interactivity)(make web pages alive) [Brain/Muscles]

# JAVASCRIPT UNIQUENESS-
1. Ful
l integration with HTML/ CSS
2. Simple things are done simply
3. Supported by all major browser

# There are many languages that get  'Transpiled' [converted] by JS before they run in browser
Example-
CoffeeScript:- Description: Syntactic sugar for JavaScript.
               Features: Shorter syntax for clearer and more precise code.
               Popular With: Ruby developers.

TypeScript:- Description: Adds strict data typing to JavaScript.

Dart:- Description: A standalone language with its own engine.

       Developed By: Google.

Brython:- Description: A Python transpiler to JavaScript.
          Features: Enables writing applications in pure Python without JavaScript.
